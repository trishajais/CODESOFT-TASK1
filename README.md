## 📊 TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

A machine learning project to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster, based on various features like age, gender, class, and fare.

---

### 🔍 Project Description

This project involves building a classification model using supervised machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the well-known Titanic dataset. The goal is to analyze the data, preprocess it, and build a model that accurately predicts survival.

---

### 📁 Dataset

* **File**: `Titanic-Dataset.csv`
* **Source**: Classic Titanic dataset (likely from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic))

---

### ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Load and Inspect Data**
   Use `pandas` to read and display dataset information and statistics.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Missing values analysis
   * Value counts of categorical features
   * Distribution of the target variable `Survived`

3. **Preprocessing**

   * Imputation of missing values
   * Dropping irrelevant columns (`Cabin`, `Name`, `Ticket`)
   * One-hot encoding for categorical features (`Sex`, `Embarked`)
   * Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`

4. **Model Building**

   * Splitting dataset into training and test sets
   * Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and SVM models are used
   * Accuracy metrics and confusion matrices are evaluated

---

### 🧪 Technologies Used

* Python 🐍
* Jupyter Notebook 📓
* pandas, NumPy
* scikit-learn
* Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

### 📈 Model Evaluation

The notebook includes evaluation metrics like:

* Accuracy score
* Confusion Matrix
* Classification Report

Each model's performance is compared to find the best fit.
